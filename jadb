Problem: Chunked String Merge

Description

You are given two strings instr1 and instr2, and an integer innum.

Your task is to construct a new string outstr by merging instr1 and instr2 based on the following rules:
	1.	If innum is greater than or equal to the length of instr2, append instr1 followed by instr2 and return the result.
	2.	Otherwise:
	•	Starting from the left, repeatedly take innum characters from instr1, then innum characters from instr2, and append them to outstr.
	•	Continue this process until one or both strings have fewer than innum characters remaining.
	•	Once one string runs out of characters, append the remaining characters of instr1 followed by the remaining characters of instr2 to outstr.

Return the final merged string outstr.

⸻

Input Format
	•	instr1 — a string
	•	instr2 — a string
	•	innum — a positive integer

⸻

Output Format
	•	Return a string representing the merged result.

Examples

Example 1
Input

instr1 = "Industry"
instr2 = "Ready"
innum = 7

Output

"IndustryReady"

Explanation
innum is greater than the length of instr2, so concatenate instr1 and instr2 directly.

⸻

Example 2
Input

instr1 = "Raines"
instr2 = "Bowls"
innum = 2

Output

"RaBoinwless"

Explanation
	•	Take "Ra" from instr1, "Bo" from instr2
	•	Take "in" from instr1, "wl" from instr2
	•	Append remaining "es" from instr1 and "s" from instr2

⸻

Constraints
	•	1 ≤ instr1.length, instr2.length ≤ 10⁵
	•	1 ≤ innum ≤ 10⁵
	•	Strings contain only lowercase or uppercase English letters

⸻

Complexity Targets
	•	Time: O(n + m)
	•	Space: O(n + m)

This problem tests controlled string traversal, chunk-based merging, and clean edge-case handling. Production-grade logic, zero fluff.
